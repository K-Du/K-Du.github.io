### Introduction
In groups of four, we were supposed to download and clean
We called ourselves _VeKeJoDa_ based on our first names.

The first issue with the data was that the number of turnstile entries and exits was cumulative, showing a number well into the millions. We only want the number of entries for each particular time period. The way to solve this was to use the `.diff()` method to find the difference between aIterating through the whole dataset to do this was too time-intensive,

This challenge was a great introduction to data munging and showing us how real world data looks like (terrible). It was
